## How would we read in a string variable called 'name' and print out that the person has a short name if the name is less than 5 characters, that they have a normal name if it between 5 and 8 characters, and that they have a long name otherwise?


elif (len(victor)) = <5:
    print('you have a normal name')
elif (len(victor)) == 5><8:
    print('you have a long name')


## How can we use the 'for' statement, the 'len()' function, and the 'range()' function to print every element in a list?

for i in range(len('victor')):
   print(i, 'victor'[i])

### How does this work?
it checks the lengh of victor and then prints victor line by line
